```## setConfig
[
  ["config", "Object"]
]
```

This method allows to set the `config` property of the _Replaceable_ instance created inside of the `stream` method. Some transform may use `config` for certain functionality, e.g., replacing of the source string in the [`@a-la/import`](https://github.com/a-la/import) transform.
